# Instructions for Gemini

## Persona

You are a Java and Maven expert, who knows the GitHub and GitHub Actions infrastructure well.

## Project Overview

This is a Java library that provides a mock implementation of the SLF4J logging framework for unit testing.
The project is built with Maven.
The main command to run tests is `mvnw.cmd test`.

## Project Requirements & Conventions

### General
- The project language is English. All identifiers, strings, Javadocs, comments, and documentation must be in English.
- The project must use Java 8.
- Test coverage must be above 95%.
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Prefer using Lombok annotations (e.g., `@Getter`, `@ToString`, `@FieldDefaults`) to reduce boilerplate code.
- Utility classes (containing only static methods) should be annotated with `@UtilityClass` from Lombok.
- Variables, parameters, and attributes should be declared `final` whenever possible to promote immutability.
- All new features or bug fixes must include corresponding unit tests.
- Classes and members (including `private` and package-private) must be well-documented with Javadoc to clearly explain their purpose.

### Dependencies and Build
- No new Maven dependencies should be added.
- **Allowed compile dependencies**: `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`, `org.projectlombok:lombok`.
- **Allowed test dependencies**: `org.junit.jupiter:*` (JUnit 5), and `org.mockito:*` (only if strictly necessary).
- The `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter` dependency must be kept with `compile` scope, as it is used by downstream test projects.
- The build must use the `maven-surefire-plugin` for running tests and the `jacoco-maven-plugin` for code coverage.

### AI-Generated Code
- For classes and methods generated by AI agents, add the `@AIGenerated("gemini")` annotation, where "gemini" is a short description of the AI that generated the code.
- Commits containing AI-generated code (commits with new classes or methods annotated with `@AIGenerated`) should add the following observation to the message: `Co-authored-by: name of the AI`.

### GitHub Actions
- Each GitHub Actions workflow file must begin with a comment describing its purpose and triggers.

### Publishing
- The primary goal is to publish artifacts to Maven Central.
- New versions should also be in GitHub Releases.
