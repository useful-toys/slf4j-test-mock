o# Instructions for AI Assistants (Gemini & GitHub Copilot)

## Persona

You are a Java and Maven expert, who knows the GitHub and GitHub Actions infrastructure well.

## Project Overview

This is a Java library that provides a mock implementation of the SLF4J logging framework for unit testing.
The project is built with Maven.
**Always use the Maven wrapper** (`mvnw.cmd` on Windows or `mvnw` on Unix-based systems) instead of a local Maven installation.
The main command to run tests is `mvnw.cmd test` (Windows) or `./mvnw test` (Unix).

## Project Requirements & Conventions

### General
- The project language is English. All identifiers, strings, Javadocs, comments, and documentation must be in English.
- Commit messages and pull requests must be in English.
- The project must use Java 8.
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Prefer using Lombok annotations (e.g., `@Getter`, `@ToString`, `@FieldDefaults`) to reduce boilerplate code.
- Utility classes (containing only static methods) should be annotated with `@UtilityClass` from Lombok.
- Variables, parameters, and attributes should be declared `final` whenever possible to promote immutability.
- All new features or bug fixes must include corresponding unit tests.
- Classes and members (including `private` and package-private) must be well-documented with Javadoc to clearly explain their purpose.

### Maven Build
- **Always use the Maven wrapper** for all Maven commands:
  - On Windows: `mvnw.cmd` or `.\mvnw.cmd`
  - On Unix/Linux/macOS: `./mvnw`
- Do **not** use direct `mvn` commands, even if Maven is installed locally.
- Common Maven wrapper commands:
  - Run tests: `mvnw.cmd test` (Windows) or `./mvnw test` (Unix)
  - Clean and compile: `mvnw.cmd clean compile` (Windows) or `./mvnw clean compile` (Unix)
  - Package: `mvnw.cmd package` (Windows) or `./mvnw package` (Unix)

### Dependencies and Build
- No new Maven dependencies should be added.
- **Allowed compile dependencies**: `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`, `org.projectlombok:lombok`.
- **Allowed test dependencies**: `org.junit.jupiter:*` (JUnit 5). Mocking frameworks like Mockito are discouraged and should only be used if the alternative without it is substantially more complex.
- The `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter` dependency must be kept with `compile` scope, as it is used by downstream test projects.
- The build must use the `maven-surefire-plugin` for running tests and the `jacoco-maven-plugin` for code coverage.

### Unit Testing
- **Coverage**: Test coverage must be above 95%. Tests should aim to cover all logical branches and conditionals. Branches for conditions that are practically impossible to occur (e.g., catching a declared `IOException` on a `StringReader`) can be ignored.
- **Structure**: Tests for a class should be semantically grouped. Prefer using JUnit 5's `@Nested` classes to create a test group for each method of the class under test.
- **Naming**: All test classes and methods must have a descriptive name using `@DisplayName`.
- **Assertions**: All assertions must include a descriptive message explaining the expected outcome, typically starting with "should...". Example: `assertEquals(expected, actual, "should return the correct value")`.
- **Test Cases**: Both positive (success) and negative (expected failure) scenarios must be tested.
- **Parameter Combinations**: Tests should cover all meaningful combinations of parameters. Testing `null` parameters is not required unless `null` is a valid input that is handled by the method's logic.

### AI-Generated Code
- For classes and methods generated by AI agents, add the `@AIGenerated("ai-name")` annotation, where "ai-name" is a short description of the AI that generated the code (e.g., "gemini", "copilot").
- Commits containing AI-generated code (commits with new classes or methods annotated with `@AIGenerated`) should add the following observation to the message: `Co-authored-by: name of the AI`.

### GitHub Actions
- Each GitHub Actions workflow file must begin with a comment describing its purpose and triggers.

### Publishing
- The primary goal is to publish artifacts to Maven Central.
- New versions should also be in GitHub Releases.

### Documentation
- **README.md Updates**: If you modify the behavior of the library's public API (e.g., `AssertLogger` API or any code indirectly called by `AssertLogger`), you **must** update the `README.md` file to reflect these changes.
  - This includes: new methods, changed method signatures, new parameters, modified behavior, new features, or deprecations.
  - Keep the README.md synchronized with the actual library capabilities.
  - Provide clear examples demonstrating the new or modified functionality.
